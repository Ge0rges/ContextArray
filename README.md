# ContextArray
An array that updates itself based on the current computing context in order to find elements that are more likely to appear soon, faster. This is based on the encoding principle of the brain.

This is more of brain picking project for myself to design a simple data strcuture that implements this idea efficiently. Please feel free to pull request if you have good ideas to improve it or even to add seperate data structures that implement this idea!
